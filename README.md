Here's a summary of the different Python scripts for web scraping data from the Central Bank of Russia website according to this repo:

1. PDF to CSV converter (```DM_pdfToExcel.ipynb```): This script uses the tabula library to convert PDF files into CSV format, merges all the CSV files into a single XLSX file, and then merges all the sheets within the XLSX file into one. This can be useful for anyone who needs to extract data from PDF files and analyze it in a spreadsheet.
2. INN number scraper (```DM_cbr_finorg_parse.ipynb```): This script uses the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape data from the Central Bank of Russia's website. The user inputs a list of Taxpayer Identification Numbers (INN), which are then used to construct a list of URLs. The script fetches the HTML content of each URL, parses the tables with BeautifulSoup, and transforms them into DataFrames with pandas. The script outputs '1' if the table is not empty, '0' if it is, and 'error' if an exception is raised.
3. OGRN number scraper (```DM_cbr_finorg_parse.ipynb```): This script partially duplicates the previous one. The user inputs a list of Major State Registration Numbers (OGRN), which are used to construct a URL for each number. The script retrieves the HTML content of each URL, extracts a specific table from it, and creates a pandas DataFrame with the table data. The resulting DataFrame is then displayed.
4. Registry data scraper (```DM_cbr_registry_parse.ipynb```): This script uses xlwt, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to interact with the Central Bank of Russia website's HTML source code. It navigates to a specific URL and clicks a "Load more" button multiple times to load more data onto the page. The script then searches for specific div elements with a class of "title-source offset-md-4" to extract the desired data, and saves the titles and URLs to separate sheets in an Excel workbook. Finally, the script saves the workbook to a file named "test_New.xls". This can be useful for anyone who needs to extract registry data from the Central Bank of Russia website and analyze it in a spreadsheet.
